# Pokemon_Project_MachineLearning

As Pokémon trainers of the 21st century, we are going to use Machine Learning to help us make the right choice of Pokémon and thus win our battles. To do so, we will rely on data from the Pokédex, but also on data from the different battles to find the right prediction model that will then ensure us a victory in each battle!
